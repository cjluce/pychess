# pychess

I discovered the chess programming website: https://www.chessprogramming.org and wanted to have some fun in my free time by playing with new ideas that I've learned there.

This also seems like a nice opportunity to mess around with the Python GUI library DearPyGui: https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui .

I grabbed the aesthetic chess piece images from: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces .
